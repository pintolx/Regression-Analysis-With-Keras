# Regression-Analysis-With-Keras
The aim of the project is to determine the mean squared error of the boston housing dataset
Regression Analysis with Keras
The dataset is the Boston Housing Data
You can learn more about the Boston house price dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
In this project we try to estimate the mean squared error without any data transformations
Part 2
After standardizing the data using the StandardScaler and Pipeline modules, there was an improvement in performance of the model. The code is in bostonhousingstandarddata file
Part 3
In this part we try to improve performance of the model by using a larger model (adding an extra layer to the model), however, we get worse results than the ones in part 2. The code is in the bostonhousingdatamodeltuning file

Part 4
We shall attempt to improve performance by reducing the size of the model.
